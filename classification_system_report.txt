SYSTEM CAPABILITIES:
✅ Handles short inputs (keywords only)
✅ Processes long documents (multi-paragraph text)
✅ Manages inputs without stop words
✅ Deals with mixed-topic content
✅ Provides confidence scores
✅ Supports batch processing
✅ Error handling for edge cases

TECHNICAL FEATURES:
- Text preprocessing with NLTK
- TF-IDF feature extraction
- Laplace smoothing for numerical stability
- Vectorized operations for efficiency
- Model persistence (save/load)

USAGE EXAMPLES:
1. Interactive classification for single documents
2. Batch processing for multiple documents
3. Confidence scoring for prediction reliability
4. Comprehensive robustness testing

CONCLUSION:
The system demonstrates robust performance across various input types and successfully
classifies documents into Politics, Business, and Health categories with high accuracy.
The comprehensive testing shows the system can handle challenging inputs including
short text, long documents, technical terms, and edge cases.
